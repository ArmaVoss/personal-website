# My First Personal Website

I made this personal website as a way to learn HTML and CSS more thorougly, along with some basic JavaScript.
There are 3 main HTML Files which represent the different pages of the website and can be navigated between using the navbar.
Any changes I make to this website will be updated in this repository
